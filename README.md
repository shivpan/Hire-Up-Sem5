# Hire-Up-Sem5
Hire-Up is a Web application system based on the concept of online freelancers' marketplace. This website can be used by college going students to find small projects or internships to work on, gaining real world work experience. The website also allows the companies/start-ups to find short term workers/freelancers to work on their projects. The basic feature of this website will be to provide a communication channel between the employer and the freelancer (student). The employer as well as the freelancer is required to login and register so they can be considered as a member of the Hire-Up website. The website is also an e-commerce website which includes both freelancers and employers to take up a subscription amount.
